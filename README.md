=========

A #crosshack project that makes it easy for fellows to share the things they teach others.

Idea:
A framework for instructors to share their workshop curricula, assets, slides, handouts, etc. Makes it easier for groups to reproduce presentations.


Initial use case:
Code for America fellows undergo intense training in January before they head to their host cities in February.
